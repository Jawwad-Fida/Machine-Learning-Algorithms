    "### Preprocessing Emails\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting on a machine learning task, it is usually insightful to take a look at examples from the dataset. The figure below shows a sample email that contains a URL, an email address (at the end), numbers, and dollar\n",
    "amounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/email.png\" width=\"700px\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "While many emails would contain similar types of entities (e.g., numbers, other URLs, or other email addresses), the specific entities (e.g., the specific URL or specific dollar amount) will be different in almost every\n",
    "email. Therefore, one method often employed in processing emails is to “normalize” these values, so that all URLs are treated the same, all numbers are treated the same, etc. For example, we could replace each URL in the\n",
    "email with the unique string “httpaddr” to indicate that a URL was present.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the effect of letting the spam classifier make a classification decision based on whether any URL was present, rather than whether a specific URL was present. This typically improves the performance of a spam classifier, since spammers often randomize the URLs, and thus the odds of seeing any particular URL again in a new piece of spam is very small. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the function `processEmail` below, we have implemented the following email preprocessing and normalization steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower-casing**: The entire email is converted into lower case, so that captialization is ignored (e.g., IndIcaTE is treated the same as Indicate).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stripping HTML**: All HTML tags are removed from the emails. Many emails often come with HTML formatting; we remove all the HTML tags, so that only the content remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing URLs**: All URLs are replaced with the text “httpaddr”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing Email Addresses**:  All email addresses are replaced with the text “emailaddr”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing Numbers**: All numbers are replaced with the text “number”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalizing Dollars**: All dollar signs ($) are replaced with the text “dollar”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Word Stemming**: Words are reduced to their stemmed form. For example, “discount”, “discounts”, “discounted” and “discounting” are all replaced with “discount”. Sometimes, the Stemmer actually strips off additional characters from the end, so “include”, “includes”, “included”, and “including” are all replaced with “includ”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Removal of non-words**: Non-words and punctuation have been removed. All white spaces (tabs, newlines, spaces) have all been trimmed to a single space character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of these preprocessing steps is shown in the figure below. \n",

To find the index of a word, we can use `vocabList.index(word)` which would return a number indicating the index of the word within the list. If the word does not exist in the list, a `ValueError` exception is raised. In python, we can use the `try/except` statement to catch exceptions which we do not want to stop the program from running. You can think of the `try/except` statement to be the same as an `if/else` statement, but it asks for forgiveness rather than permission.\n",
